# SAVEM - Efficient Safety Validation for Autonomous Systems Using Meta-Learning
This repository contains all our code. Once the paper is accepted for publication, we will add more infromation about the usage here, but most of the code is well-documented and the `train.py` file contains all the experiments for the generic example using an inverted pendulum. Before the conference, we will also include a slightly more complicted problem.
